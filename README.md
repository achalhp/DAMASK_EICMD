## DAMASK_EICMD

This is a DAMASK fork with "Discrete deformation twinning model" implementation based on work done by Dr. Satyapriya Gupta and Dr. Philip Eisenlohr at MSU.)

### The Discrete deformation twinning model

>We introduce stochasticity for the nucleation and growth events of twinning through random sampling, similar to Monte Carlo Methods.
>The ease or difficulty of a twinning event is controlled by adjusting the frequency of sampling.
>At each voxel, the state of twinning is treated as a discrete quantity, unlike the approach based on diffused volume fraction.
>The kinetics of twinning occur in the form of a “jump,” rather than following a rate equation as in the “pseudo-slip” approach.
>The jumped state is evaluated using the correspondence matrix from Niewczas, Acta Materialia, 2010.
